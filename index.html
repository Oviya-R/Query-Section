    <h4>Frequenty Asked Questions</h4>
    <div class="all">
        <div class="answer" tabindex="1">Why is the moon sometimes out during the day?</div>
        <div class="hide">The Earth's daily revolution on its axis means that the Moon is actually above the horizon for about 12 hours out of every 24. Usually, some portion of that time will be during daylight â€“ you just need to look carefully, because its brightness is so much less than the Sun's.</div><hr>
        <div class="answer" tabindex="1">Why is the sky blue?</div>
        <div class="hide">Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time.</div><hr>
        <div class="answer" tabindex="1">Will we ever discover aliens?</div>
        <div class="hide">Although no extraterrestrial life has been found and life may still be just a rarity from Earth, there are scientific reasons to suspect that it can exist elsewhere, and technological advances that may detect it if it does. Many scientists are optimistic about the chances of finding alien life.</div><hr>
        <div class="answer" tabindex="1">How much does the Earth weigh?</div>
        <div class="hide">13,170,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1.3 x 1025) pounds! That's thirteen septillion!</div><hr>
        <div class="answer" tabindex="1">How do airplanes stay up?</div>
        <div class="hide">Airplane wings are shaped to make air move faster over the top of the wing. When air moves faster, the pressure of the air decreases. So the pressure on the top of the wing is less than the pressure on the bottom of the wing. The difference in pressure creates a force on the wing that lifts the wing up into the air.</div><hr>
